            I wanted to create a website with ample breathing space, avoiding any elements that might induce claustrophobia, such as excessive text or buttons. 
            However, this presented challenges: how to balance simplicity without leaving users staring at empty space or endlessly scrolling. 
            To combat blandness, I experimented with fonts, color schemes, hover effects, and animations. 
            Addressing spacing concerns, I played around with margins, paddings, alignments, and font sizes, opting for percentage values for responsiveness. 
            Discovering the use of the <hr> tag, I separated the page creatively which let me make spaces feel less empty. 
            Though I invested way too much time in bird animations, I restrained their use to prevent overwhelming users. 
            I didn’t want the birds distracting the user from reading the text or from viewing the images.
            I aimed for a header that succinctly conveyed the website's theme—my passion for birds—without distracting from content. 
            Clearing HTML validator errors proved time-consuming, often having me restyling due to small adjustments affecting layout drastically. 
            Despite these challenges, I'm satisfied with the outcome, achieving a balance between simplicity and engagement.

                        A few years ago, on a hot day while we were watering plants in our backyard, my family and I noticed sparrows starting to appear, using the water to drink and wash themselves. 
                        Ever since then, we began putting out food and water for them.
                        This became a daily routine, and I realized that watching those birds would calm me down and make me appreciate what I have. 
                        It was nice to see that these small animals were also part of our world, doing things like us such as eating, drinking, and cleaning themselves. 
                        This made me realize that I like birds a lot, and I think they are very cool. 
                        Occasionally, we would have other guests such as pigeons, squirrels, and one time, I even saw a parrot, hawk, and seagull. 
                        I was able to take pictures of a few, and in 2020, while camping, I saw even more birds that we don't usually see. 
                        Although I think birds are cool I am not really an expert in them and would often get their type wrong, but this is more of a hobby and not something that bothers me. 
                        These two pictures are some I am proud of taking.

                    <img src="eagle.jpg" class="image-description" width="500" height="500" alt="An image of a hawk looking directly at the camera" title="hawk-image">
                    <p>
                        This hawk came to our backyard one day. I think this hawk saw all the smaller birds and animals and was just waiting for them to show up as I am pretty sure all hawks are carnivores. 
                        On the day this hawk came, I had just bought a professional camera and was trying to understand it. 
                        This made me very excited because earlier I was just thinking about a target to capture. 
                        The picture makes it look like I am close to it but in reality I am very far away (and well hidden). 
                        The hawk found me in no time which allowed me to take this shot. 
                        This just goes to show how perceptive animals are and how keen their senses can be. 
                        The patterns on its feathers are really cool too. 
                        I thought it was an eagle until recently but looking at pictures on google made me realize it’s a hawk.

                    <p>
                        Right before the lockdown happened in 2020, I had gone camping with a friend in hopes to see more animals and get a chance to disconnect from my usual life. 
                        Throughout the day I heard some aggressive knocking and that got my attention towards a tree poked with countless holes in them. 
                        And very far away I could see a small bird working on making more holes. 
                        I zoomed my camera all the way through and took this photo. 
                        This was my first time seeing a woodpecker both in person and in general. 
                        I am not sure why but I assumed they looked like Woody the woodpecker from an old cartoon I used to watch. 
                        Still this is a picture I am proud of and I think the color scheme, long beak and the patterns on these birds are really cool.
